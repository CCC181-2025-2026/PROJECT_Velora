🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and develop VELORA, an IoT-based wearable emergency response system that aims to enhance personal safety and improve emergency response efficiency within Upper Hinaplanon, Iligan City. The project addresses the critical need for a reliable and accessible emergency alert mechanism, particularly in situations where individuals are unable to use mobile phones due to injury, panic, or physical limitations.

VELORA integrates a wearable wristband device with real-time health monitoring, location tracking, and instant alert transmission. By combining sensor-based detection, a panic button, and location services, the system ensures that emergency alerts are generated accurately and delivered promptly to the appropriate recipients, including family members, barangay responders, medical teams, and local authorities. This multi-level alert approach helps minimize delays and ensures coordinated response during accidents, medical emergencies, security threats, or disaster-related incidents.

Another key purpose of the project is to reduce false or accidental emergency alerts by incorporating basic verification mechanisms and structured alert routing. This improves trust in the system and prevents unnecessary deployment of emergency resources. Additionally, the project emphasizes secure handling of sensitive user data, ensuring that health information and location details are shared only with authorized recipients.

Beyond individual safety, the project aims to support barangay-level emergency preparedness by providing responders and local government units with real-time data that can improve decision-making and response coordination. Through the use of IoT and wearable technology, VELORA promotes innovation, encourages responsible use of digital solutions, and contributes to the development of safer, smarter, and more resilient communities.
